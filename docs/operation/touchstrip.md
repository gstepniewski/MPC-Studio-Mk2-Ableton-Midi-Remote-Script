# Intro

There are a few components to the Touch Strip functionality, the Touch Strip itself, the **Touch Strip** button, the red LEDs and the white note division markers (off by default).
The Touch Strip always affects the currently selected track.
There are 3 basic ways in which the Touch Strip can be used:

## Track level feedback

When not in use, the red LEDs will display either the track output level (if the track is outputting anything) or the value of the Level parameter (if it's not).

## Track parameter control

Holding the **Touch Strip** button allows a track parameter to be selected using the pads. The top four pads correspond to:
* Volume
* Pan
* Send A
* Send B

Use the Touch Strip to set the selected parameter for the current track. The Touch Strip will display the current parameter value using the red LEDs while the Touch Strip is held.

## Note Repeat

While in Pad Mode B (Notes), when the **Note Repeat** button and a pad are held down, you can use the Touch Strip to trigger notes repeated in a specific interval, synchronized with the project clock.
In this mode, the white note division LEDs are lit up and you can hold down a corresponding segment of the Touch Strip to trigger notes at that interval.
